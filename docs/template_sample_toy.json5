      doc_about: "This is a sample \"About\" notice.\n\nThe About section exists to explain what this application is and, just as importantly, what it is not. It provides orientation rather than instruction or persuasion, helping users form an accurate mental model before relying on the tool for anything meaningful. This section is intentionally descriptive, not authoritative: it explains scope, intent, and limitations, but it does not define obligations, guarantees, or enforceable terms.\n\nOne of the primary purposes of the About section is to describe the core responsibilities of the application in plain language. For example, it may explain that the app is designed to locally generate, store, and use cryptographic keys for signing and verification, and that these operations occur entirely on the user’s machine. It can also outline the kinds of guarantees the app attempts to uphold—such as user control, transparency, and minimal automation—along with the assumptions it makes about responsible use, including secure backups and careful handling of key material.\n\nIt is equally important for the About section to clarify boundaries and non-goals. This is where the application can explicitly state what it does not do: it is not a cloud service, not a recovery mechanism, not a password manager, and not a substitute for operational security practices. By naming these limits directly, the About section reduces the risk of users inferring capabilities that were never intended to exist.\n\nThe About section is also non-canonical. Its contents are not signed, hashed, or incorporated into any cryptographic operation performed by the application. Only the actual document text selected for signing constitutes the signed payload. As a result, any validating authority, arbiter, mediator, or third party must treat the About section as explanatory context only. It cannot be considered part of an agreement, declaration, or attestation, and it carries no binding or evidentiary weight with respect to signed material.\n\nFinally, the About section can communicate design philosophy and intent. It provides space to explain why certain choices were made—such as favoring explicit user actions over automation, or local simplicity over networked convenience—without those explanations becoming entangled with signed content. In this way, the About section helps users understand how to use the tool wisely, while keeping a clear and intentional separation between guidance and what is actually committed to by a cryptographic signature.",
